# Project 4 - Unit Testing and Code Review

## Phase 1 

before run the action, go to seetings and setup the Twitter API access keys. 

While running action there is error message says: Process completed with exit code 1.

this means there is some issue caused the program to exit. Maybe the port that runs the program is currently in use or not closed, so end up with an exit code 1. 


### The detailed code can be found in the Project2 folder.
